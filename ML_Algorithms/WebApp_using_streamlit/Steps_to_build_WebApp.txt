Steps to follow to make stramlit app with any ML algorithm

step -1: train the model using a ML algorithm

step -2: import the trained model file(serialization) using Joblib library

step -3: install the streamlit

step -4: load the joblib trained model file into streamlib

after following the above instruction you can can attach any ML algorithm model to the streamlit for making web apps
